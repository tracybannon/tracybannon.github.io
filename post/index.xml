      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to consider all the moving parts with even the simplest of website using static content. Even the simplest directions may have a nuance that can cause unexpected results.
Seems like common sense, right? The trouble in simply following instructions without understanding the intentions and the context make troubleshooting a huge challenge.
This can be fantastic for learning purposes but what of when we take this approach without adding time for upskilling, experimenting, and refactoring?</description>

Diversity takes on many forms including age and generation !</description>
